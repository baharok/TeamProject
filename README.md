# Project 2: GitHub Repository and Branch Management

## Objective
Simulate a development team workflow by creating and managing branches in a GitHub repository.

## Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Sign in to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository named "TeamProject".

### 2. Create Branches

Create the following branches in your repository:
- Back-End
- Front-End
- Develop
- DevOps

### 3. Commit Code to Each Branch

#### Back-End Branch
1. Write a simple Python script (e.g., a function or a small application).
2. Commit the code to the Back-End branch.
3. Modify the code (e.g., add a new function or fix a bug) and commit the changes.

#### Front-End Branch
1. Write a basic HTML page with some CSS styling (e.g., a simple webpage layout).
2. Commit the code to the Front-End branch.
3. Update the HTML and CSS (e.g., add more content or enhance the design) and commit the changes.

#### Develop Branch
1. Integrate some code from the Back-End and Front-End branches if necessary.
2. Commit any relevant integration code or documentation.

#### DevOps Branch
1. Write a simple script or configuration file relevant to DevOps practices (e.g., a shell script for automation or a configuration file for a service).
2. Commit the code to the DevOps branch.

### 4. Documentation

Document the purpose of each branch and the changes made in each commit.

## Branches Overview

### Back-End Branch
Purpose: This branch is dedicated to server-side code, including business logic, database interactions, and server configurations.

Commits:
1. Initial Commit: Added a simple Python script with a basic function.
2. Update: Added a new function to enhance functionality and fixed a minor bug.

### Front-End Branch
Purpose: This branch handles the client-side code, including HTML, CSS, and any client-side JavaScript.

Commits:
1. Initial Commit: Created a basic HTML page with simple CSS styling for layout.
2. Update: Enhanced the design by adding more content and improving CSS styles.

### Develop Branch
Purpose: This branch is for integrating code from the Back-End and Front-End branches. It serves as a staging area for testing combined functionality before merging to the main branch.

Commits:
1. Integration: Merged code from Back-End and Front-End branches and added integration documentation.

### DevOps Branch
Purpose: This branch contains scripts and configurations for automating development operations, deployments, and other DevOps practices.

Commits:
1. Initial Commit: Added a shell script for automating deployment tasks.
2. Update: Created a configuration file for a continuous integration service.
